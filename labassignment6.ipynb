The bad news is that each piece of additional software comes with its own complications. This problem will guide you through the installation steps for the software you need to run database systems on your computer, document those databases, and connect to them through Python with (fingers crossed) as few problems as possible."

While we will not be delving into the topic of containerization in this course, a container is space in your computer's memory that is set apart from the rest of your computer. We can act as if the container is an entirely new computer, and inside the container we can change the operating system and install other software external to Python, such as database management systems. We can use a container to run Windows on a Mac, or vice versa, or Linux on any system. By far the easiest way to run MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB is through Docker containers. \n",
